# Postpartum LARC Study (postpartum-larc)

### Summary
We will be using a synthetic patient database simulating California inpatient discharge data to do a proof of concept study in support of Dr. Jen Franks’ research interests. Specifically, we’ll be looking at the utilization of immediate postpartum LARC (long-acting reversible contraceptives) at California hospitals to determine if Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield was an outlier for not offering these procedures before residents did advocacy work in recent years. The goal is to support the preparation of a data request for HCAI, and to create an analytic program that can be repeated when that real-world data is obtained.

### Status
Project initiation is nearing completion and we are assembling a team to begin work on the project in the new year.
