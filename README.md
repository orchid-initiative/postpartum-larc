# Postpartum LARC Study (postpartum-larc)

### Summary
We will be using a synthetic patient database simulating California inpatient discharge data to do a proof of concept study in support of Dr. Jen Franks’ research interests. Specifically, we’ll be looking at the utilization of immediate postpartum LARC (long-acting reversible contraceptives) at California hospitals to determine if Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield is an outlier for not offering these procedures. The goal is to support the preparation of a data request for HCAI, and to create an analytic program that can be repeated when that real-world data is obtained.

### Status
The general project concept is ready, but the project team hasn't been assembled yet.  We are targeting a project kick-off in November 2023.
