# Project Charter 

## Executive Summary
We will be using a synthetic patient database simulating California inpatient discharge data to do a proof of concept study in support of Dr. Jen Franks’ research interests.  Specifically, we’ll be looking at the utilization of immediate postpartum LARC (long-acting reversible contraceptives) at California hospitals to determine if Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield is an outlier for not offering these procedures.  The goal is to support the preparation of a data request for HCAI, and to create an analytic program that can be repeated when that real-world data is obtained.

## Business Case / Background

**Why are we doing this?**
- Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield is hesitant to place immediate postpartum LARC because of concerns for reimbursement.  Given the strong benefits in the literature, a study looking at overall utilization of this resource by hospitals would be beneficial for better contextualizing the contraceptive environment, particularly for patient populations whose only interaction with the healthcare system is during the immediate postpartum period.  We think it is standard of care in other hospitals, but we need the data to back that up.
- This data source is new to Dr. Franks, so the hope is that we can use synthetic data to demonstrate the use case before jumping through the hoops required to get access to real data.
- The hope is that the analysis will be repeated on real-world data obtained from HCAI and used to bolster the argument that these procedures should both be offered by the medical centers in the Central Valley and should be covered by the health insurance providers most commonly associated with those patients.
